	<p>Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a full contact team sport, which originated in England in the early 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each goal line.</p> 
	<p>Rugby Union has different positions in which each player from each side can play in, Overall the game of rugby union is made up of 15 players with extra's used for substitutions.The Positions in rugby are split into two main catagories, these are Forwards and Backs. Forward positions are Front Row, Second Row and Back Rows. While the Back Positions are made up of Half Backs, Three Quarters and Fullbacks</P>
	<p>The growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were let to play amongst themselves . During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy and Czechoslovakia.In 1934, instigated by the French Rugby Federation, FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRB.The founding members were Italy, Romania, Netherlands, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden. Other European rugby playing nations of note include Russia.</p>
